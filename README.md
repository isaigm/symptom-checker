# Symptom Checker

## Description
This project focuses on deploying a machine learning model using XGBoost with a React-based desktop interface. The goal is to practice deploying models in production while focusing on machine learning rather than web development.

## Disclaimer
Please note that the approach used in this project for predicting diseases is **not correct** and should not be used for any real-world medical applications. This project serves only as an educational example to help me learn about machine learning deployment. A more robust system for disease prediction would require in-depth medical knowledge, clinical data, and statistical analysis to ensure reliability and accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **XGBoost**: For training the machine learning model
- **React**: For building the front-end interface
- **Python**: For backend and machine learning model deployment
